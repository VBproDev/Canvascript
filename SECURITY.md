The contributors of this software believe in the software philosophy of [continuous deployment](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-deployment#:~:text=Continuous%20deployment%20is%20a%20strategy,directly%20to%20the%20software's%20users.). 

So, the current version, which is hosted [here](https://vbprodev.github.io/Canvascript/) and whose source code is available on Github, is the **only supported version** and you are responsible for updating any clones of this software that you have taken in the case any security vulnerabilities are found, though such an event is extremely unlikely due to the nature of this software.
